## **Project Overview**


Credits Warriors is a 2D tower defense game inspired by *Plants vs. Zombies*, developed as a final project for the Window Programming course in NCKU 2025 Fall.

## **The Motivation-Gamifying the Academic Battlefield**


For this Unity project, our team sought to create a game that resonates deeply with our peers—the survival struggle of a Computer Science student.
As a sophomore at National Cheng Kung University, we recognized that maintaining a decent GPA through all courses is a huge challenge. After enduring countless assignments and exams, we collectively realized that university
life as a CS student is literally an ongoing "war".

Since my team members and I are all fans of the classic *Plants vs. Zombies*, we decided to adopt its iconic 
framework as our creative foundation, reimagining it through the lens of student life.


## **Gameplay Mechanics**


There is only one simple goal: Defend your Diploma. If any Academic Monsters reach the Diploma, the game fails.
### 1.The "Liver" Economy
In this game, "Fresh Livers" serve as the primary currency for deploying characters.

-**Initial Wealth**: Players start each game with 20 Livers.


-**Generation Methods**: Fresh Livers are acquired through two main channels

   (a) Deploying Sleeping Students allows players to periodically generate extra Livers.

   
   (b) The system will randomly generate Liver Rain Drops from the sky. Players can collect the Livers by clicking them.
   

### **2.Tactical Defense Deployment**
Players must defend their Diploma (located at the far left) by deploying units across four active lanes (Lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7).

- **Defensive Units:**

Each defender has a specific cost in Livers(on the label)

   (a) Normal Student: Each costs 3 Livers, an attacking unit that fires a single projectile at a time.

   
   (b) Straight-A Student: Each costs 5 Livers, an attacking unit that shoots double projectiles per interval.

   
   (c) Sleeping Student: Each costs 2 Livers, with the function of generating fresh Livers.

   
   (d) AI TA: Each costs 4 Livers, a specialized support unit that freezes the monster it first encountered once in its lane for 3 seconds.

- **Deployment Controls**

Left-click a student in the shop to select, then click a lane to deploy. Right-clicking before placement cancels the purchase.

   (a) Exam Monster: 
   - Spawn Rate: 15%
   - HP: 5
   - Description: A high-HP tank that is difficult to defeat, representing the heavy pressure of midterm and final exams.

     
   (b) Deadline Monster:
   - Spawn Rate: 35%
   - HP: 3
   - Description: Features significantly higher movement speed.


   (c) Assignment Monster:
   - Spawn Rate: 50%
   - HP: 3
   - Description: The basic unit of academic stress, representing standard assignments.


### **4.Dynamic difficulty**
The game lasts 90 seconds, but the intensity is dynamic.


   - The Surge: At specific time stamps, players must endure the Midterm and Final Exam waves, where the spawn rate of Academic Monsters increases drastically.
   - The TimeBar: A visual progress tracker showing the progress of gameplay.


### **5.Risk & Reward: The Lucky Spin**
Players can spend 8 Livers for a gamble.

   - Potential Buff: Doubling your current Livers, freezing all the monsters, and clearing all active monsters.

   - The Risk: The "Try Again" result, where your 8 Livers are spent with zero benefit
